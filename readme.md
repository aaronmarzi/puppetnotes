This is a repo with notes and other information I found useful when learning Puppet.  

Some I created exclusively, others are a combination of notes and other documents I found around the web and I am not trying to steal or claim credit for those, so if they look like yours, they might be in some form or another.

If you found this, then hopefully you find it useful.
